                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4"><em><strong>by Ronnel Bermas</strong><br></em><br><em>Preludes, Op. 15 No. 1
</em><em><br></em><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I was told to focus my eyes on an object, to be so absorbed until it seems like the world is teeming less with everything time has robbed. So I gazed at that old picture of mine; I hoped to recount what I have missed out—a hazy nostalgia, perhaps even a memory hiding like a bundle of kittens behind a bush. But I didn't see any; instead, I saw a pair of dark orbs, my eyes digging back for more minutes—I realized then that I had exchanged places with my reflection.
<br> 
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The mirror told me it can no longer hold my thoughts—its stagnancy compelled me to be still while my body was warped in its spaces. I'd like to believe it was the universe telling me there were better places to look for peace. 
<br> 
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I stared for a while until it could no longer etch my figure. How can it grasp what has merged with words far beyond what this world could pronounce—when it has reached where fiction loses all its crumbs and settles for cliches?
<br> 
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And I remember now why I used the picture frame to withdraw my focus—I was hoping to see if I had lost myself while visiting the stars.
<br> 
<br>***
<br> 
<br><em>Preludes, Op. 15 No. 2
</em><em><br></em><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am writing again to carry the weight of stars; because glimmer, as I was told, loses itself with too much light—that the only way for it to thrive was to be surrounded with darkness. The ceiling was ripe with lines and the windows seemed to implore more light. I touched the blanket as though it was my chest. My heart pulsated as it fertilized the sheets with more warmth.
<br> 
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was there too much darkness inside my room?
<br> 
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The pillow clasped my head like it was an extension of my back. There, I put myself to rest—the warm oxygen escaping my lungs, a string of nonexistent words that jittered as the light faded into the hull. 
<br> 
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There were no stars above my head today, and there need not be—I only hoped to legitimize my feelings through them.
<br> 
<br>***
<br> 
<br><em>Preludes, Op. 15 No. 3
</em><em><br></em><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The first day I did it, my head mistook it as an iteration of wandering, in spaces unexplored—in ideas that withered along with the sun. It felt like a nice shower after a day of exposure to heat. It was my way of hearing the secrets this house would never tell. I was aware, nothing could be slivered from an empty breeze. But it offered subtlety.
<br> 
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The objects can never be blank. They can never lie.
<br> 
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To focus, then, is to innately let the soul understand when the body could not. And you might be asking, has this person gone mad after days of being aware?
<br> 
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yet, I'm not mad. I wish I could call introspection a despicable name; I wish I could turn all this world's hate into laughter.
<br> 
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now, as of writing, I began noticing how the air throbs with each exhale—as though to signal the molecules of death to find another target.
<br> 
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This person is still breathing.
<br> 
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Disturbance could be a good sign too.
<br> 
<br>***
<br> 
<br><em>Preludes, Op. 15 No. 4
</em><em><br></em><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If it is still not clear, I am writing to say there are more sounds in silence than in noise. I am estimating the history of the items I have inspected for ten minutes—to help me remember that once, I have caged myself in a glass. That I have removed myself from the frame to gather more pictures.
<br> 
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On this page, I display each in what I hoped to be a translation of my consciousness, sketching the truth out of an expanse that has offered itself to be a hiding place, perfectly aware—love does not grow when left as lost dots finding one another through lines that will never connect.
<br> 
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And maybe, after I pen my last dot, you would begin to see your magic too—in places obscured with too much noise.
<br> 
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I found mine reverberating from the ambivalence of these lines. I fleshed out a sanctuary with all my awareness pigmented into words—
<br><br>—because I was hoping to meet someone by the end of this line.
