                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-1"><strong>AN ITRODUCTION:</strong><br><strong>OMORI stretches towards the inventive side of fiction no narrative has ever claimed.</strong></h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4"><em>It is with loss that we realize a part of us will be taken, kept by the person bidding farewell, forevermore. And only by acceptance, does the crumpled piece of love, guilt, or sorrow—ever unfasten into a levity, marked with remembering. 
<br></em> 
<br><em><strong>Enter OMORI, a psychological horror RPG-maker game co-published by Playism and directed by OMOCAT</strong></em>, where the stretches of the narrative of loss are defined through the use of a facade: pixelated graphics, simple pencil art style, and a plot that seems inconspicuous in the first hour. By peeling it, the player uncovers the game’s manner of leaving bread crumbs with each arc unveiling the grim truth.
<br> 
<br>The fictional world of OMORI itself, even to the teeniest details, of tentacles poking from puddles of water, reveals a Freudian disposition of coping by avoidance. Ironically, this defense mechanism leads to a tendency of making the things one wants to forget more vivid, as the need to hide the truth... is an action that begs, nay needs, attention. It is a cycle that can unforgivingly repeat so long as emotions and traumas are left unprocessed. 
<br> 
<br>Dissociative Amnesia, the psychological illness OMORI seemingly attempts to depict, is characterized by an inability to recall specific or general details about oneself; psychologists believe that this is the mind’s attempt to distance trauma-related events from conscious awareness, a maneuver of sorts to spare oneself from distress. In severe cases, one may also experience Dissociative Fugue, where one wanders away from its usual environment or contrives a new identity for oneself. The given disorders have both been mythologized in the game. 
<br> 
<br>OMORI reimagines reality in pastel-colored undertones as it opens to its namesake character, Omori, in Whitespace, an endless void of black and white preluding a room where his friends—Aubrey, Hero, and Kel—await him. This, albeit its playful backdrop, conceals demons—a fact mystified through rounds of Basil "finding out the truth" and attempting to feed such to Omori. The game, after Basil's initial discovery, then reveals that everything is a dream and that Omori is just Sunny's self-image in his dreams. To maintain the facade, the dream regularly ensures that Basil will not interact with Omori further—his friends gradually lose their memories of Basil, effectively distancing him from the truth as well. As the game progresses, the player learns of the friends' real-life counterparts whom Sunny has not contacted in years because of the suicide of Mari, his sister. 
<br> 
<br>And truthfully, It is with loss that Sunny realizes a part of him was taken, kept solemnly by Mari, forevermore. And only by acceptance, does the crumpled piece of love, guilt, or sorrow... ever unfasten into a levity, marked with remembering. It’s up to the player to experience the game through his eyes, half-lidded or closed; to stay in his orchestra of dreams, or reconnect with familiar faces and voices. Either way is a path towards something.
<br> 
<br>Here, we probe into the nature of grief as we carve words out of the silence of death—mourning the sounds it would have made had it been living; our minds birthing to a world where letters and words become placeholders for voices and movements that once occupied spaces. Because to live, as we believe, is to capture moments from blankness—to make narratives from the barrenness of somebody's room.
<br> 
<br>Perhaps, feeding these pages with our precious energies could restore something—even if it may not last long to witness you growing up.
<br> 
<br>Hold on to it.
<br> 
<br><em>May you enjoy remembering as much as we have when we pieced the prose, poems, and art together.
</em><br>
