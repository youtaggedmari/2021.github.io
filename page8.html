                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-1"><strong>OMORI stretches towards the inventive side of fiction no narrative has ever claimed.</strong></h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4"><em>It is with loss that we realize a part of us will be taken, kept by the person bidding farewell, forevermore. And only by acceptance, does the crumpled piece of love, guilt, or sorrow—ever unfasten into a levity, marked with remembering.</em>
<br>
<br>Enter OMORI, a psychological horror RPG-maker game co-published by Playism and directed by OMOCAT (OMOCAT, LLC., n.d.), where the stretches of the narrative of loss are defined through the use of a facade: pixelated graphics, simple pencil art style, and a plot that seems inconspicuous in the first hour. By peeling it, the player uncovers the game’s manner of leaving bread crumbs with each arc unveiling the grim truth.
<br>
<br>OMORI reimagines reality in pastel-colored undertones as it opens to its namesake character, Omori, in Whitespace, an endless void of black and white preluding a room where his friends—Aubrey, Hero, and Kel—await him. This, albeit its playful backdrop, conceals demons—a fact mystified through rounds of Basil "finding out the truth" and attempting to feed such to Omori. The game, after Basil's initial discovery, then reveals that everything is a dream and that Omori is just Sunny's self-image in his dreams. To maintain the facade, the dream regularly ensures that Basil will not interact with Omori further—his friends gradually lose their memories of Basil, effectively distancing him from the truth as well. As the game progresses, the player learns of the friends' real-life counterparts whom Sunny has not contacted in years because of the suicide of Mari, his sister.
<br>
<br>The fictional world of OMORI itself, even to the teeniest details, of tentacles poking from puddles of water, reveals a Freudian disposition of coping by avoidance. Ironically, this defense mechanism leads to a tendency of making the things one wants to forget more vivid, for the need to hide the truth is an action that begs, nay needs, attention. It is a cycle that can unforgivingly repeat so long as emotions and traumas are left unprocessed.
<br><br><strong>GRIEF AND ESCAPISM IN TODAY’S WORLD</strong>
<br>Dissociative Amnesia, the psychological illness OMORI seemingly attempts to depict, is characterized by an inability to recall specific or general details about oneself; psychologists believe that this is the mind’s attempt to distance trauma-related events from conscious awareness, a maneuver of sorts to spare oneself from distress. Remarkably, the recovery of one’s memory is often linked to the disappearance of the traumatic experience where the amnesia stemmed (American Psychological Association, n.d.-b).  In severe cases, a person may also experience Dissociative Fugue, where one wanders away from their usual environment or contrives a new identity for oneself (American Psychological Association, n.d.-c). The given disorders have both been mythologized in the game.
<br>
<br>Leaning towards the entanglement of extreme fiction to reality, the game meditates on the impermanence of beauty when used as a vessel to delay—or prolong—suffering. Escapism, as the American Psychological Association (n.d.-a) defines it, is a tendency to evade reality through “the delight and security of a fantasy world.” The game undeniably uses this as a critique of suffering; indeed, it unnoticeably establishes its connection with the players by allowing them to live inside the make-believe realm in a way that mimics themselves—escapists.
<br><br>The 21st Century is fraught with a variety of distractions or, for this matter, mediums of escapism. A 2017 journal article posits playing video games as one of the most frequently studied escapist media activities, regarding it as effective in terms of gratifying one’s urge to temporarily disengage oneself from the world (Hastall, 2017). Mobile video gaming in the United States is expected to rise to 11.35 Billion USD in 2025—a clear sign of exponential growth for escapist media (Clement, 2021).
<br>
<br>With the looming dilemma, of whether to confront problems head-on or otherwise, OMORI delivers the paradox of hypnotism—that is, escaping reality to process it better—as a means to convince its audience to act. It masquerades them as boats in stagnant rivers, where disturbance is a precondition to progress.
<br>
<br><strong>JUNGIAN ARCHETYPES IN THE GAME
</strong><br>Carl Jung, a Swiss psychiatrist and an expert on the study of religious and mythological symbology, once noted that similar patterns, themes, and symbols have existed in different myths and religions; in addition, he also noticed that such figures were also present in dreams and fantasies of patients with schizophrenia (Academy of Ideas, 2018). He, after discovering this, insinuated that the mind—apart from being constructed by personal experiences—has pre-personal elements shared by all. He called these elements the Archetypes.
<br>
<br>The game is ripe with symbolic representations of what could have been Sunny’s state of mind: Knife, Flowers, Hands, Mirrors, and more. These symbolisms can be deduced as portions of his Personal Unconscious where temporarily forgotten and repressed memories are contained because of their history. The Personal Unconscious, when used in such context, is the same as Freud’s unconscious (McLeod, n.d.).
<br>
<br>Meanwhile, a further dive into Sunny’s Collective Unconscious—an unconscious universal to the man derived from the brain’s inborn structure—reveals direct representations of his archetypes. For instance, Blackspace personifies the Shadow Archetype, the aspect of one’s personality undesirable to one’s conscious ego that so much of it remains hidden in the unconscious (American Psychological Association, n.d.-d). His refusal to acknowledge himself fully then, according to Jungian thought, becomes an impediment to his personal growth and progress.
<br>
<br>Otherwise, he would achieve Individuation, defined as the gradual development of a unified unconscious for both the Personal and Collective Unconscious (APA Dictionary of Psychology, 2014)—the ideal for individuals who struggle with psychological conflicts (Academy of Ideas, 2016). One of the most observable symbols is in Omori’s sketchbook at Whitespace, <a href="page25.html#image3-3p" class="text-secondary" target="_blank">a mandala-esque sketch of motifs present in his dream world</a>; its geometrical arrangement, in various cultures, depicts a symbol of order, and its presence suggests an individual tackling <a href="https://medium.com/@WilliamLamkin/the-mandala-an-archetype-of-the-self-72c30146d39d#:~:text=The%20mandala%20is%20an%20archetypal,use%20them%20as%20meditative%20tools." class="text-secondary" target="_blank">disorientation or re-orientation.</a>
<br>
<br><strong>THE OVERARCHING QUEST AND ITS UNDERLYING VOYAGE
</strong><br>Among stories, when an important goal has to be achieved or a certain location must be trekked by the protagonist and their companions, is The Quest—one of the seven basic plots enumerated by Christopher Booker (2011), an English journalist and author in the 1900s, who modeled it heavily after Jungian analysis to uncover the underlying psychological meaning of narratives. In the game, the plot progresses to the point where Basil mysteriously disappears overnight, which prompts Omori and company to investigate his whereabouts by traversing through different areas of Headspace, Sunny’s dream world.
<br>
<br>Each and every completion of an area proves to be in vain as Basil will almost always be nowhere to be found. This will often be followed by reassurance from Hero or Mari, who will convince the friend group to continue searching. But when morning comes, Omori promptly returns to reality by waking up from Headspace, and resumes his life as Sunny once again.
<br>
<br>Upon getting out of bed, one of his first notable quests is grabbing a snack after exiting his bedroom. But the moment he attempts to descend the stairs, his body seizes up, each step downwards teeming with reluctance. His Acrophobia, weighing down his panicked heart, takes the form of a pitch-black monster—curdled into the form of the wooden banister, its body fading into an unknown dark. Eventually, Sunny learns to breathe and calm himself by the recollection of Mari’s support. He descends down the stairs coolly, and the monster is nowhere to be found—he overcame it.
<br>
<br>This pattern of progression is observed after every arc, where Omori gains a new skill from Headspace and converts it to a learning that helps overcome his phobias in real life as Sunny. From this, we can conclude that the plot is not purely The Quest, but also relies on Voyage and Return; another one of the seven basic plot points, when the protagonist explores a strange land aimlessly and faces the threats that come with it—typically, returning with experience and knowledge.
<br>
<br>Inevitably, the game rounds up Sunny and Omori’s learnings, the Collective Unconscious and the Personal Unconscious, building up to the climax of Individuation—by facing Basil, who was never lost to begin with, but was only waiting to be found. Its plot transitions from explorations of Headspace to Blackspace, the last area to explore, where Sunny’s repressed fears and memories lie. It is precisely there where he comes face-to-face with the decision of bearing the truth his mind wanted to forget. And this decision, is entirely up to the player’s hands.
<br>
<br>But whichever path prevails, leads to an avenue of acceptance that either destroys, or rebuilds. The mark of loss is an internalized pain, a psychological shape, a work of the mind, and a predator of the Unconscious.
<br>
<br><br><strong>CONCLUSION
</strong><br>Truthfully, it is with loss that Sunny realizes a part of him was taken, kept solemnly by Mari, forevermore. And only by acceptance, does the crumpled piece of love, guilt, or sorrow ever unfasten into a levity, marked with remembering. It’s up to the player to experience the game through his eyes, half-lidded or closed; to stay in his orchestra of dreams, or reconnect with familiar faces and voices. Either way is a path towards something.
<br>
<br>Here, we probe into the nature of grief as we carve words out of the silence of death—mourning the sounds it would have made had it been living; our minds birthing to a world where letters and words become placeholders for voices and movements that once occupied spaces. Because to live, as we believe, is to capture moments from blankness—to make narratives from the barrenness of somebody's room.
<br>
<br>Perhaps, feeding these pages with our precious energies could restore something—even if it may not last long to witness you growing up.
<br>
<br>Hold on to it.
<br>
<em><br>May you enjoy remembering (and accepting) as much as we have when we pieced the prose, poems, and art together.</em>
